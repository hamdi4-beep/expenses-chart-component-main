## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the bar chart and hover over the individual bars to see the correct amounts for each day
- See the current day’s bar highlighted in a different colour to the other bars
- View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device’s screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Use the JSON data file provided to dynamically size the bars on the chart

## My process

As I started the project, I made a list of components that make up the app. This helped me focus on which component is going to have the responsibility. I picked easier to recognize names for the components.

With Tailwind CSS, I added the styles starting from the top and working my way down. I focused on getting the project up and running as soon as possible, so I can adjust the small details later on. Plus, I'll have something presentable and a visible progress.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) - CSS Framework

**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

### What I learned

I learned to set up projects with more confidence without wasting time on fixing issues such as config files confliction.

I also learned to make better decisions when I'm making a component in React. Every component has a single responsibility. And I've also made them reusable.

### Continued development

In the future, I'll be displaying the chart bars based on the fetched data from the JSON file. And there's going to be more emphasis on component tree structure.
